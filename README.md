1) What are HTTP methods? List all HTTP methods that you know, and explain them.

- GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.

- POST
The POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI.

- HEAD
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.

- PUT
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI.

- DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

- TRACE
The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.

- OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL.

- CONNECT
The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.

- PATCH
The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.
